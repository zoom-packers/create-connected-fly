/**
 * A single equipment slot that holds Engineer's Goggles, so they can be worn without giving up the
 * helmet. Original to this port -- upstream Create: Connected has nothing like it.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why it exists at all.</b> Create Fly counts you as wearing goggles only when they are in the
 * HEAD slot, or when a mod registers another way of checking. Trinkets Updated is that mod, and
 * Create Fly already ships compat for it. This is for players who do not want Trinkets' other
 * slots -- the elytra-in-a-slot kind of thing -- and it deliberately holds goggles and nothing
 * else. Anyone wanting a general accessory system should install Trinkets Updated; when it is
 * present this slot stands down so nobody ends up with two goggle slots.
 * <p>
 * <b>No Trinkets code is used here.</b> Their implementation was read to understand the problem
 * -- it is MIT, so copying would have been allowed with its notice kept -- but everything below is
 * written against Fabric's own APIs, which is why no MIT notice accompanies it. If a later change
 * lifts code from them, that file takes the notice.
 * <p>
 * The stack lives in a data attachment rather than a capability or an extra inventory row: it is
 * persisted by the attachment's codec, synced to the owning player by the API, and survives a
 * dimension change without any code of ours. It syncs to everyone tracking the wearer, not just
 * the wearer, because {@link GoggleSlotLayer} draws the goggles on other players too.
